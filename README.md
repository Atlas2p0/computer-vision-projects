# computer-vision-projects

This repo is a collection of my learning of computer vision machine learning through hands-on projects.


## File Hierarchy

This is the template I'll be following when structuring each project in this repo

```
project_01
├── data                   # Compiled files (alternatively `dist`)
├── notebooks                    # Documentation files (alternatively `doc`)
├── src                     # Source files (alternatively `lib` or `app`)
├── models                    # Automated tests (alternatively `spec` or `tests`)
└── README.md
```

* data folder: Contains the data and labels used to train models (The structure here may vary from project to project depending on the dataset)
* notebooks folder: Contains all the notebooks i used for prototyping, experimenting and learning (This will be left in a bit of a raw/undoctered state so i can track my progress)
* src: Contains the final working scripts of the notebooks folder final iteration
* models: Saved models from training experiments
