# computer-vision-projects

This repo is a collection of my learning of computer vision machine learning through hands-on projects.


## File Hierarchy

This is the template I'll be following when structuring each project in this repo

```
project_01
├── data                   # training data (images/labels)
├── notebooks              # notebooks used for prototyping, experimenting, and learning
├── src                    # final working code from "/notebooks"
├── models                 # saved models from training runs
└── README.md
```
